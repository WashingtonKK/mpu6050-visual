The program will display the orientation of an MPU6050 on the processing platform

The code, MPU6050.ino should be uploaded to the arduino board
Remember not to open the serial monitor in your arduino platform

Then the code in the processing folder should be opened in the processing platform

The 3D model used is for a basic airplane, you can change it to whatever you desire.

Enjoy the work.
Regards!
